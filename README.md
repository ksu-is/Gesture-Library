# Gesture-Library
This app stores and shuffles images for gesture/figure drawing sessions.

The basis for drawing anything starts with gesture and one of the best ways to practice gesture drawing is with quick sketches. An artist will have his/her choice of images
displayed on screen and shuffled for a default duration of 20 minutes which can be increased or decreased as needed. A single session can be split between 30s, 2min, 5min, and
10min poses.
