**Project Roadmap**

> The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a common method for application development and code management. It is intended as a way to gain a solid experience of how code gets made in organizations and a sense of how things can go right and wrong. The goal of the project is to understand how to design and manage code projects in my work by developing a program that artists can enjoy. 


### Sprint 1   

- [x] Have an approved project topic
- [x] Establish a Github account and join class organization (KSU-IS) in Github by accepting the invite email.
- [x] Associate ownership of a code repository in Github organization.
- [x] Edit and commit changes in a readme.md file in the repository in Github organization. The commits should show in Github.
- [x] Explore at least one existing Python code base related to the project to evaluate using it in the project and submit updates to the projectroadmap.md file explaining any findings. 


### Sprint 2  

Start coding and use git to manage the code. 

- [x] Update and add commit messages in the repository in ksu Github organization. Use Github desktop. 
- [x] Commit at least 6 code changes of significant size (not just a spelling error fix for example). 
- [x] Each commit should include a comment that explains what was done. The comment must be specific (ie. not just Updated README.md but rather explain what your update was and why you did it briefly).

- [x] Track progress on planned and emerging tasks in projectroadmap.md document. Use checkboxes, add new tasks as they emerge, and add “DONE” to markdown items.
 

###  Sprint 3  

1. [x] Continue coding and refining and testing in Sprint 3 as in Sprint 2.

2. [x] Create one PowerPoint slide introducing the project and upload it. The slide should be attractive and informative. 

Rquired:
```
- Self-introduction.
- Project Title.
- Display a tag line that introduces the main concept of what the prgram does.

- Show 1-2 screenshots or pictures demonstrating the idea or parts. Upload the PPT slide in D2L. 
- Ensure there is a copy in the Github repository so that future coders can quickly grasp the idea.
```
